I decided to improve the dal website one day because I was not able to search for credit equivalencies (which is silly)

This program runs through the Dalhousie University Transfer Credit webpage and grabs all the information on ever class, institution, and province/state available.

It then converts all the data into a useable CSV file, strips the special characters and other unnecessary characters then uploads it to a remote MySQL server.

Then I wrote a website that downloads that data and allows it to be searched which is a feature that the Dal website does not have.
