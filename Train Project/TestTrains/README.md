Following TDD, wrote python scripts that met the following requirements:

• Train stations are where travellers wait to get on a train. At any given time, there may be
up to 200 travellers waiting. Every hour, 0-25 new travellers show up. When a train
arrives, travellers have a 50% chance of embarking.

• Passengers already on a train have a 40% chance of disembarking upon arrival at a
station. If it is the last stop on a train’s route, then all passengers disembark.
Disembarked passengers simply leave the station and don’t come back.

• Trains follow a set path on a fixed schedule. They must always start and stop at the
same station. Trains can carry up to 75 passengers at a time.

• All train stations are directly connected to every other station, so a train can move from
any station A to another station B without intermediate steps.rains
